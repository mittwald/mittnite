# Mittnite - Smart init system for containers

Mittnite is a small, but smart init system designed for usage as `ENTRYPOINT` in container images.

It offers the following features:

- Render configuration files from templates using Go's [`text/template`](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) engine.
- Start processes and manage their lifecycle
- Watch configuration files and send configurable signals to processes on change
- Wait until required services are up before starting processes (currently supporting filesystem mounts, HTTP services, MySQL, Redis, AMQP and MongoDB)

## Getting started

### CLI usage

#### Basic
```bash
$ mittnite --help

Mittnite is a small, but smart init system designed for usage as `ENTRYPOINT` in container images

Usage:
  mittnite [flags]
  mittnite [command]

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  renderfiles
  up
  version     Show extended information about the current version of mittnite

Flags:
  -c, --config-dir string   set directory to where your .hcl-configs are located (default "/etc/mittnite.d")
  -h, --help                help for mittnite

Use "mittnite [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

#### Render templates and execute custom command
This will render all template files and execute the `sleep 10` afterwards.
```bash
$ mittnite renderfiles sleep 10
```

### Docker
#### Build your (go) application on top of the `mittnite` docker-image
In order to run your own static application - e.g. a `golang`-binary with `mittnite`, we recommend to inherit the `mittnite` docker-image and copy your stuff on top.
```dockerfile
FROM            quay.io/mittwald/mittnite:stable
COPY            mittnite.d/ /etc/mittnite.d/
COPY            myApplication /usr/local/bin/
# ENTRYPOINT and CMD are optional, because they are inherited by parent image
```

#### Download `mittnite` in your own custom `Dockerfile`
If you'd like to use `mittnite` for non-static applications like `node` or similar, you can download the `mittnite`-binary from Github.
```dockerfile
FROM        node:12-alpine
ENV         MITTNITE_VERSION="1.1.2"
RUN         wget -qO- https://github.com/mittwald/mittnite/releases/download/v${MITTNITE_VERSION}/mittnite_${MITTNITE_VERSION}_linux_x86_64.tar.gz \
                | tar xvz mittnite -C /usr/bin && \
            chmod +x /usr/bin/mittnite
COPY        mittnite.d/ /etc/mittnite.d/
ENTRYPOINT  ["/usr/bin/mittnite"]
CMD         ["up","--config-dir", "/etc/mittnite.d"]
```

## Configuration

The directory specified with `--config-dir`, or the shorthand `-c`, can contain any number of `.hcl` configuration files.

All files in that directory are loaded by `mittnite` on startup and can contain any of the configuration directives.

### Directives

#### Job

A `Job` describes a runnable process that should be started by mittnite on startup.

A `Job` consists of a `command` and (optional) `args`. When a process started by a Job fails, it will be restarted for a maximum of `maxAttempts` attempts. If it fails for more than `maxAttempts` time, mittnite itself will terminate to allow your container runtime to handle the failure.

```hcl
job "foo" {
  command = "/usr/local/bin/foo"
  args = ["bar"]
  maxAttempts = 3
  canFail = false
}
```

You can configure a Job to watch files and to send a signal to the managed process if that file changes. This can be used, for example, to send a `SIGHUP` to a process to reload its configuration file when it changes.
  
```hcl
job "foo" {
  // ...

  watch "/etc/conf.d/barfoo" {
    signal = 12
  }
}
```

You can also configure a Job to start its process only on the first incoming request (a bit like [systemd's socket activation](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.socket.html)). In order to configure this, you need a `listener` and a `lazy` configuration:

```hcl
job "foo" {
  command = "http-server"
  args = ["-p8081", "-a127.0.0.1"]

  lazy {
    spinUpTimeout = "5s"
    coolDownTimeout = "15m"
  }

  listen "0.0.0.0:8080" {
    forward = "127.0.0.1:8081"
  }
}
```

The `listen` block will instruct mittnite itself to listen on the specified address; each connection accepted on that port will be forwarded to the address specified by `forward` (**NOTE**: mittnite will do some simple layer-4 forwarding; if your upstream service depends on working with the actual client IP addresses, you'll only see the local IP address).

If there is a `lazy` block present, the process itself will only be started when the first connection is opened. If the process takes some time to start up, the connection will be held for that time (the client will not notice any of this, except for the time the process needs to spin up). mittnite will wait for a duration of at most `.lazy.spinUpTimeout` for the process to accept connection; if this timeout is exceeded, the client connection will be closed.

When no connections have been active for a duration of at least `.lazy.coolDownTimeout`, mittnite will terminate the process again.

#### File

Possible directives to use in a file definition.

```hcl
file "/path/to/file.txt" {
  from = "examples/test.d/test.txt.tpl"
  params = {
    foo = "bar"
  }
}

file "/path/to/second_file.txt" {
  from = "examples/test.d/second_test.txt.tpl"
  overwrite = false
  params = {
    foo = "bar"
  }
}
```

#### Probe

Possible directives to use in a probe definition.

```hcl
probe "probe-name" {
  wait = true

  redis {
    host = {
      hostname = "localhost"
      port = 6379
    }
    password = ""
  }
  
  mysql {
    host = {
      hostname = "localhost"
      port = 3306
    }
    credentials = {
      user = "foo"
      password = "bar"
    }
  }
  
  amqp {
    host = {
      hostname = "localhost"
      port = 5672
    }
    credentials = {
      user = "foo"
      password = "bar"
    }
    virtualhost = "amqp.localhost.com"
  }
  
  mongodb {
    url = "mongodb://localhost:27017/mongo"
  }
  
  http {
    scheme = "http"
    host = {
        hostname = "localhost"
        port = 8080
    }
    path = "/status"
    timeout = "5s"
  }
}
```

Specifying a `port` is optional and defaults to the services default port.

### HCL examples

#### Start a process

```hcl
job webserver {
  command = "/usr/bin/http-server"

  watch "/etc/conf.d/*.conf" {
    signal = 12 # USR2
  }
}
```

#### Start a process lazily on first request

```hcl
job webserver {
  command = "/usr/bin/http-server"
  args = ["-p8081", "-a127.0.0.1"]

  lazy {
    spinUpTimeout = "5s"
    coolDownTimeout = "15m"
  }

  listen "0.0.0.0:8080" {
    forward = "127.0.0.1:8081"
  }
}
```

#### Render a file on startup

```hcl
file "/etc/conf.d/test.txt" {
  from = "examples/test.d/test.txt.tpl"

  params = {
    foo = "bar"
  }
}
```

#### Wait until a Redis connection is possible

```hcl
probe redis {
  wait = true
  redis {
    host = {
      hostname = "localhost"
      port = 6379
    }
  }
}
```
